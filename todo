- in CallableNumericFunctionTest :
   - tests if callable is callable
   - tests $minParams <= $maxParams

- instead of CallableNumericFunction, maybe I should write a CallableScalarFunction class ?

- in FunctionCommand, an instance of FunctionInterface must be provided instead of a callable

- in Compiler, Registered functions must implements Mormat\FormulaInterpreter\Functions\FunctionInterface

- create class CallableStringFunctionTest

- Make sure that all exceptions implements Mormat\FormulaInterpreter\Exception

- the operators + - \ *  must execute with numeric values only

- implements the comparison operators = < > <= >= . Works only with numeric and string values

- implements the 'in' operator. Works only with strings and array

- in OperatorParser, pay attention to the quotes. The operator must not be between quotes because it's part of a string.

- in OperatorParser, the method must be probably be improved by caching results in memory

- in Readme.md, write "A stand-alone php library for interpreting formulas" in description and remove quotes from examples showing formulas

- remove PHP Warnings

- rename CustomFunctionNotCallableException to IncompatibleFunctionException
